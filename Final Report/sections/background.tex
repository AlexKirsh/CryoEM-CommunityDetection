\subsection{Heterogeneous 1D \acrlong{MRA} model}

In our project we will use the Heterogeneous 1D \acrlong{MRA} statistical model\cite{boumal2018heterogeneous} (\acrshort{MRA} shortly) for the sake of \acrshort{cryo-EM} data abstraction. Bellow is the definition of the model.\\
Let $x_1,...,x_K \in \mathbb{R}^L$ be $K$ unknown normalized signals (distinct even up to shift) and let $R_s$ be the cyclic shift operator: $(R_sx)[n]=x[\langle n-s \rangle_L]$. We are given $N$ observations:

\begin{equation}
y_j = R_{s_j} x_{k_j} + \varepsilon_j, \quad j=1,...,N
\end{equation}

where $s_j \sim U[0, L-1],k_j \sim U[0, K-1]$ and $\varepsilon_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2I)$ is i.i.d white Gaussian noise. Our goal is to estimate the signals 
$x_1,...,x_K$ from the observations.\\
Simply speaking, \acrshort{MRA} observation is a randomly chosen signal $x_{k_j}$, shifted randomly by $s_j$ and distorted using white noise. \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:fig2}} shows an example of two \acrshort{MRA} observations at different noise levels.

  \caption{\textbf{Example of \acrshort{MRA} observations at different SNR levels.} Each column shows a shifted distinct signal at different noise level. We can see that for low \acrshort{SNR} the task of signal estimation is quite challenging.}

\end{figure}

In order to build a graph from \acrshort{MRA} observations, a similarity measure between observations must be defined. We will use the cross-correlation, as its invariance to shift holds great value.

\begin{equation}
(x \star y)_n \triangleq \sum_{l=\infty}^{\infty}x^*_l(y)_{n+l}
\end{equation}

The convolution theorem states that the convolution of two signals  equals to the inverse Fourier transform of the product of the Fourier transforms of each signal. Thus we can write the equation above in terms of Fourier transforms and later exploit \acrshort{FFT} in our simulations.

\begin{equation}
(x \star y)_n = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\lbrace X^* \cdot Y {\rbrace}_n
\end{equation}

In order to obtain normalized cross-correlation \acrshort{MRA} samples must first be normalized.
